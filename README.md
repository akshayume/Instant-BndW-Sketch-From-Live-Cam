# Instant-BndW-Sketch-From-Live-Cam
Here the main idea is to convert the image into a grayscale and then blur the background. Then we will add the black and white foreground to the blurred image. To separate the background we will be inverting the image and then we will blur it, and our final output will be a pencil sketch of the provided image or the frame recorded in the webcam.
